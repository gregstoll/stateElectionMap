npm run build - do production build

Note that the @semantic-ui-react/css-patch stuff is to fix this issue: https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React/issues/4287#issuecomment-1016579332

How to add a new year:
- Add new data <year>.csv to public/data/electionResults
  - Get data from uselectionatlas.org or Wikipedia
- Set new MAX_YEAR in src/DataHandling.tsx 
- If it's the first election after a new decade:
  - Add new electoral votes file in public/data/electoralVotes
  - Set new MAX_ELECTORAL_VOTE_YEAR in src/DataHandling.tsx
- In min_votes_to_change_result, do `cargo run` (this only works on Windows because of path stuff, feel free to fix that)
- From here, run `npm run test` (this doesn't work??)
- `npm run build`
